Lecture 1 is about creating and styling home page. Install live server extension in vs code for live output. 
we will use rem. it is that if we change root font size anythings using rem, it will change accordingly 
as well. 
we used font size 62.5%. it looks strange but in most browser, the default size is 16px so it is 62.5%
of the screen. 

by default the border is set to content box means width and height applies to contents of elements.
box-sizing:border box, but border box means if box has 50, then this 50x50px will be assigned to whole container 
(content+padding+border). 

display flex, justify content center will give horizontal and align items center will do it vertical. 
we can use use justify content:flex-start, flex-end.

we can use hover, and button[disabled]. disabled means when button has been clicked. we can set cursor 
not-allowed. 


After adding all the css properties, we will move to lecture 02. 
create game.html and css page.
